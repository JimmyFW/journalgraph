Graph search for academic articles.

Authors: Aman Kapur and Jimmy Wu

Built at Olin College of Engineering as a part of an AI class.

Introduction
=====
We built a graph database of indexed science journal articles by scraping http://arxiv.org/

We have around 2000 articles, all in the realm of high energy physics and quantum cosomology.

Our scraping functions ensure a graph as complete as the information arxiv gives us.

We implemented search algorithms to allow the user to search using different ranking criteria.

Front-end: a search box which allows the user to choose ranking functions
* Simple boolean match, ranking by article id
* Term frequency (TF) ranking
* TFIDF ranking
* PageRank
* PageRank and TFIDF (most accurate and relevant)

Users can "explore" a topic by traversing our graph.
* They can view related articles (generated by graph properties and ranked by Levenshtein distance).
* They can also traverse by author.
* They can view all articles given by a given author.
* They can look at authors related to a given author.

Database representation
=====
Nodes are articles and authors.
Edges are articles-article, article-author, and author-author relations.

Article nodes hold metadata such as publication date, and subject category.
They also hold information to aid the search engine:
* abstract keywords via automatic summarization
* ranking factors, such as PageRank
